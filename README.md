Promineo Tech's Week 9 assignment was to create a multi-page website using HTML & CSS Bootstrap in which every element is styled and class, id, and element selectors are used to create style rules.

I decided to create a site that lists how to prepare for autumn and winter (using tables). This being the first time I used Bootstrap, I had a lot of fun creating more clean and stylish navigation bars and tables.
